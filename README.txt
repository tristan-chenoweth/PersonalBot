This bot is a personal project. 

It is a work in progress. 
I will be adding more functionality to it as time goes on. 
This will not work without the token key. I have intentionally left that of the repository to ensure security of both the bot and servers it is active in. 

As of now it currently runs locally on my laptop at home but can be moved into a persistant workspace so that is is always available. 

People are welcome to use this as a starting point or a reference. I will try to add comments to the main bot.js file to explain what each section of the code is doing.
